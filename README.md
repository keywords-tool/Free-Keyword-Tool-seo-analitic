Filtering Free Keyword Results by Industry
With Free Keyword Tool you also have the option to filter your results by industry, which specifies your results and other data including search volume, competition level and estimated CPC so they’re all maximally relevant to your industry.

For example, if you search for keywords related to “cars” while selecting “Arts & Entertainment” as the industry, you’ll see results like “cars movie,” “disney cars,” and “pixar cars.” However, if you input the same term and change the industry to “Finance & Banking,” you’ll see results like “new car incentives” and “new car lease.”

You can filter your results by 24 business verticals, including Apparel, Arts & Entertainment, Autos & Vehicles, Beauty & Fitness, Books & Literature, Business & Industrial, Computers & Electronics, Finance & Banking, Food & Drink, Toys & Games, Health, Hobbies & Leisure, Home & Garden, Internet & Telecom, Jobs & Education, Law & Government, News Media & Publications, Family & Community, Occasions & Gifts, Pets & Animals, Real Estate, Retail & General Merchandise, Sports & Fitness, and Travel & Tourism.
